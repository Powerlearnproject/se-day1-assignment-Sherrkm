Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the branch of computer science where developing, maintaining and testing software happens.
The importance of software engineering in technology is to ensure software is efficient, reliable, high quality, secure, scalable and flexible.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering machine: better understanding of machines, algorithms and better design models for software applications for data processing
Mastering complexity: having a more in depth understanding of the different components of the computer
Mastering process: ensuring the final step of developing software is polished and efficient

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: process of identifying the software requirements, purpose and scope
Requirement analysis: identifying the final user specifications
Design: building the framework of the software
Coding: converting the software design into code
Testing: ensuring the software is bug free and runs smoothly

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology: Each phase of development is completed before moving to the next. Mostly used when the requirements are clear and a lot of changes can be expensive.
Agile methodology: The phases of development are more flexible, changes can be applied after every sprint and is highly adaptative. Used when the project is complex and has a higher risk of encountering problems.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer : develops applications systems and programs, maintains the software, works with other team members, reports to the project manager through entire process of development.
Quality Assuarance Engineer: formulates the standards to be followed during development, works closely with stakeholders to ensure standards are met, analyses the programme for bugs, ensures the software is up to standard before deployment
Project Manager: Leads and assembles the team, creates project brief and blueprint, works closely with clients, Tracks the milestones throughout the project and communicates with the team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software platforms that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. Example Visual Studio Code.
Importances include: 1. Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code. 2.An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors. 3.an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing. 4.IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out. 5.An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application. 6. The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run. 7. Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.
Version Control System are are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Example Git.
Importances include: 1. Records the details of changes made to code. 2. Allows many developers to collaborate on the same codebase without conflict. 3. Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Limited or  unavailable Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
 Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.
-Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Write an essay
Clear, specific, consice prompt: Write a 1000 word essay on the importance of gender inclusivity and representation of university panels and challenges faces while making these changes.
